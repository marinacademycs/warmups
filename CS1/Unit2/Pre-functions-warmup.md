# Pre-Functions Warmup

### 1. Define each of the following:
  * debugging
  * printf debugging
  * breakpoints
  * constants, aka magic numbers
&nbsp;  

### 2. What is duck-debugging?

&nbsp;

### 3. I created a program in a file called ***myprogram.c*** and I want to debug it using debug50. What are the 3 things I need to do in order to run debug50 properly?

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

### 4. What is the output of the following program?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) 
{
   int rows = 5, number = 1;
   for (int i = 0; i <= rows; i++) 
   {
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) 
      {
         printf("%d ", number);
         number++;
      }
      printf("\n");
   }
}
```
 
### 5. Take a look at the following code and output, can you figure out what the numbers within the `%f` mean (e.g `%.2f`)? 

#### Code:  

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.141592

int main (void)
{
    printf("PI is %f \n", PI);
    printf("PI is %.1f \n", PI);
    printf("PI is %.2f \n", PI);
    printf("PI is %.5f \n", PI);
}  
```  

#### Output of above:  

```
PI is 3.141592
PI is 3.1
PI is 3.14
PI is 3.14159
```
