# Warmup 7

#### 1. What does the following for loop print? What do you notice that is different about the structure of this for loop? Why do you think that is?

```
string a = "Chairs";

for (int i = 0, n = strlen(a); i < n; i++)
  {
      printf("%c !", a[i]);
  }
    printf("\n");
```

#### 2. What does the following code print?

```
   printf("%d\n", 'A' + 'B');
   printf("%d\n", 'c' - 'A');
   printf("%c\n", 'z' - ' ');
   printf("%c\n", 'x' - 58);
   printf("%c\n", 'V' - '*' );
  
```

#### 3. In the space below, write a for loop that prints each character of a string one at a time, starting with the first character.

#### 4. Do the same as above, except start with the last character of the string and end with the first.

#### 5. Write a program that counts the number of spaces in a string, such as:

`"Hello world, we are going to do great things!"`
