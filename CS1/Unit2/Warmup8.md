# Warmup 8

#### 1. Find all the bugs in the following program. There are a LOT.

```
include <stdio.h>

int main void
{
    int a = 5, b = 10, c = 12.5;
    
    string s = get_int("Enter name: ");
    
    if (a >= b || c && A)
    {
        printf(A is biggest.\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("A is not the biggest.\n");
    }
    
    string s = 'Hello CS Students!';
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i+);
    {
        printf("%c\n", s[i]);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i--)
    {
        printf("%c", s(i));
    }
    printf("\n");
    
    printf("The 18th char is %s\n", s[17]);
    printf("The 25th char is %c\n", s[25]);
}
```

#### 2. Flashback: What are the 3 things a program needs to have in order to use a function?

#### 3. Write a function in the space below that computes the area of a triangle. It should take 2 floats as input and return the area. Make sure to include all three parts from question 2!

#### 4. Write a function that takes a string input and prints each character in that string shifted one place up. E.g. Entering "compsci" outputs "dpnqtdj \n".
