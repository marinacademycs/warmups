# Unit 0 / Warmup 1, Practice Problems -- Python Basics

&nbsp;  

### 1. Given the following code, what would each line print out if run interactively (aka, entering these in one at a time)?

    a, b, c, d, e, f, g = 5, 2, 4.5, 'a', '45', 'hello', 'world'

| Expression | Answer | Expression | Answer | Expression      | Answer |
|------------|--------|------------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| a / b      |        | a % b      |        | a > b           |        |
| c * d      |        | b * f      |        | a == b          |        |
| a ** b     |        | f + g      |        | a < c           |        |
| f * c      |        | f + g      |        | a + b > c       |        |
| a // b     |        | e + f      |        | a ** b < int(e) |        |
| int(c)     |        | float(a)   |        | a < b or b < c  |        |
| int(a)     |        | int(c) * d |        | a < b and b < c |        |
| int(d)     |        | int(e)     |        | a or b          |        |
| float(e)   |        | str(c) + e |        | a and b         |        |

### 2. There are specific rules to create variable names in Python (and other languages). Circle all valid variable names below.

| a    | _a    | hello  | name  |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 314  | #name | in     | abc   |
| main | pi314 | _3     | abc_  |
| for  | 3me   | _3me   | print |
| 45   | if    | pi_314 | hi!   |

### 5. Write a program that converts a temp from C to F ( `F = 9/5 * C + 32` ) Prompt the user for a temp in C and print the result.

### 6. Given the list of names below, write a program that prints out "Welcome to the party, [name]" using a `for` loop.

    names = ['Kyle', 'Eric', 'Parker', 'Ethan', 'Will', 'Brian', 'Connor', 'Michael']

&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### 7. Given the list of names above, write a program that prints out the vowels of each name one at a time. Hint: each name in the list is a string. Do you know or remember how to access individual characters within a string?
