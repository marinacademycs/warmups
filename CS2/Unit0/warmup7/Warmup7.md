# Unit 0 - Warmup 7 - Strings and Lists

In your IDE and with your group... hint: Do you remember how to *slice* a string?

#### 1. Write a function that takes `someString` as a parameter and returns only the FIRST half of that string. 
It doesn't matter if you round up or not.

&nbsp;   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 2. Write a function that takes `someString` as a parameter and returns only the LAST half of that string. 
It should be consistent with the above (the above should print the first half and this should print the second. They should not overlap).

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 3. Finally, write a third functions that takes two strings as parameters, and inserts the second into the middle of the first.

    stringA = 'hello'
    stringB = 'WORLD'
  
    # Your code
    
    result = 'helWORLDlo'
    
    
## List Practice

#### 4. Create an empty list with different types of values (int, float, string,). Write a for loop that iterates over each item and multiplies each item by 2.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 5. Add each item in the below list using a `for` loop, then divde the result by 3 and print that result.

    myList = [100, 500, 24, 56, 78, 93, 34, 2, 57]
