# Unit 0 - Warmup 4 (for loops, conditionals)

#### 1. What does the range() function do? 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


#### 2. What is the output of the following program:

    for i in range(0, 10, 3):
        print(i)

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


#### 3. Using a for loop, iterate through the first 500 numbers (0-499) and print only the numbers that are divisible by 2 and 13.

## Practice Problems - Functions!
For the below problems, make sure to put your code into a single file called `warmup4.py` 
Use this link to submit your work: 
    `submit50 marinacademycs/warmups/main/CS2/Unit0/warmup4`

This is the general structure of a python function:

    def myAwesomeFunction(a, b):
        '''This function raises variable a to the power of b.'''
        return a**b
    
    print(myAwesomeFunction(2,3))   
    
    # "def" means "Define", a and b are arguments 
    # "myAwesomeFunction" is the name of the function.
    # print(myAwesomeFunction(2,3)) is the function call
    
#### 4. Write a function that takes a single number and returns a new number according to the following formula:

    x * 2 / 3 + 4

#### 5. Write a function that takes 3 numbers as arguments and returns the largest. 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 6. Write a function that takes two numbers a, and b, and returns c using Pythagorean theorem ( a**2 + b**2 = c**2 ).
In order to find the sqrt of a number, you'll need to ask Google, but here's a hint:

    import math
    
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 7. Write a function that takes single string input and returns "Hello [string], tonight we dance." Make sure to add a comment in your function to indicate you expect a name!

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 8. Now make sure all of the above functions are *called* from within a main function.
