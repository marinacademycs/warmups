# Unit 0 - Warmup 5 (Functions, Strings)

You can use the IDE for these problems.

#### 1. Prompt the user to enter a string, and then repeat it back to the user, doubled.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 2. Write a function that tests whether a variable is a string or not. If it is a string, return True, otherwise False. You may use the CS50 IDE for this problem.
Hint: use the `type()` function.

Call this function with the following values: `3`, 3, 'hello', 4.5

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### Practice Problems

#### 3. Slice the string `“computer science”` so that it only shows `“science”` and then capitalize the “s”, resulting in `“Science”`.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 4. Can you do the above in just two lines of code? The first line is `a=”computer science”`. How can you capitalize and slice a string in a single line of code?

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

#### 5. Following the accumulator pattern we looked at, write a function that takes a string, creates a new string with the following:

1. Double each vowel
2. triple each consonant, except g and k
3. g & k should be removed because they are kind of useless

Do one at a time!
