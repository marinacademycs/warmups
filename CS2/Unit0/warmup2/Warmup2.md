# Unit 0 / Warmup 2, Practice Problems -- Python Basics cont. 

### 1. Given the following code, what would each line print out if run interactively (aka, entering these in one at a time)?

    a = 5.2
    b = 2
    c = 'a'
    d = 'hello'
    e = 4
    f = 'world'
    g = '32'

| Expression | Answer | Expression | Answer | Expression      | Answer |
|------------|--------|------------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| a / b      |        | e % b      |        | a > b           |        |
| c * e      |        | b * a      |        | a != b          |        |
| a ** b     |        | f + g      |        | a < c           |        |
| f * c      |        | f + g      |        | a + b > e       |        |

## The following are 6 for loop problems. Work through these in small groups. Each of you will be assigned one of the problems to write on the board.
&nbsp;  
 
### 2. Write a `for` loop that prints out the numbers 0-49.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
 
### 3. Write a `for` loop that prints out each letter in `myString` below:
 
     myString = 'abcdefghijklmnop'
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### 4. Use a for lop to print the following pattern:
 
1   <br>
1 2   <br>
1 2 3   <br>
1 2 3 4   <br>
1 2 3 4 5  <br>
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### 5. Write a `for` loop that prints the squares of each number up to the number that a user enters.
For example, a user enters `5`. Your for loop should print out:  

1 <br>
4 <br>
9 <br>
16 <br>
25 <br>
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### 6. Write a `for` loop that prints `Hello, [name], welcome to the party!` for each of these names:
 
    students = ['Kyle', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'Will', 'Connor', 'Parker', 'Ethan', 'Brian']

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### 7. Write a for loop that adds each digit in a long integer.
For example, a user enters `12345`. Your program should return `15`

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Once we complete this warmup, do the following problems in your CS50 IDE.

### 1. Compute the total of all digits up to a number given by the user according to the following rules:
    - If the nuber is even, double it and add to the total
    - If the number is odd, triple it and add to the total
e.g. the user enters: 5. = 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*2 = 24
&nbsp;  

### 2. Calculate the number of digits and letters in a string. Ask the user to enter a string, and print out the number of letter and number of digits. For example, if the user enters 'brut32', you program would return letters: 4, digits: 2'.

&nbsp;  

### 3. Sum all the odd numbers up to the number a user enters. For example, if the user enters 10, you program would compute 1+3+5+7+9.
