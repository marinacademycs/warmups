# Unit 0 - Warmup 8

### In your IDE, complete these problems.

#### 1. Write a function that checks if a string has any duplicate characters. If a duplicate is found within a string return True, otherwise False.

    "abcdef" -> returns False
    "aabbcc" -> returns True

#### 2. Write a program that analyzes a list of integers that a user enters.

To do this:

    1. Prompt the user for a number between 500 and 1000. Only accept a number within this range.
    2. Add that number of random integers to a list. The numbers should be from 0-5 digits each, and either positive or negative. 
    3. Find the **average** of the numbers entered.
    4. Find the **median** of the numbers entered.
    5. Find the **min/max** of the numbers enters.

Hint:  What is the Python function that creates random integers? How do you add, aka "append", an item to a list?

Do not use any built-in Python functions to complete items 3-5. You must use only loops and basic operations.
